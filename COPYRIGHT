pty version 4.0, February 9, 1992.
Copyright (c) 1992, Daniel J. Bernstein.
All rights reserved.

I want this program to be distributed freely in original form.

Once you've received a legal copy of this program, you can use it.
Forever. Nobody can take that right away from you. You can make changes
and backup copies for your use (or, if you're an organization, for the
use of everyone in the organization). You can distribute patches (though
not patched versions). You'd have all these rights even if I didn't tell
you about them.

Copyright law gives an author the exclusive right to copy and distribute his
works. So that you don't have to worry about these legalities, I grant you the
right to make and distribute exact and complete copies of this program.

On the other hand, I don't want this program sold without my permission.
Unless I give you permission, you may not charge for copies. You may charge for
distribution---but only if you first warn the recipient that the code is free,
and tell him where you got it from.

I don't want this program distributed without my name on it. I also don't
want lots of different versions running around, so unless I give you permission
you can't send out a modified version. It's perfectly all right to send other
people a description of how to make your changes (i.e., a patch), because then
each recipient knows firsthand what patches he's installed, and I won't go
chasing ghosts. (An author has no right to control patches in any case.)

If you run an archive site: When you receive a patch supposedly from me, do you
apply it to the original package and repackage it? I encourage you to change
your policy, if for no other reason than to give recipients a fallback in case
of buggy patches. If you're really set on this, how about including the patches
as separate, unapplied PATCHnn files inside the package? That's fine by me.

If you have questions about this program or about this notice, or if you
would like additional rights beyond those granted above, or if you have
a patch that you don't mind sharing, please contact me on the Internet
at brnstnd@nyu.edu. Special arrangements are available for vendors.
